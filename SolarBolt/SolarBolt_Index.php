	How do you know if my solar PV system is working properly? This is a very good question that
	many customers wonder. The answer is to spend some time taking readings of your electricity usage
	from your meters. </br>
	Now that you have some measurements wouldn't you like to store them and view them graphically. If the 
	answer is 'yes' then Solar Bolt is for you! 
	</br></br>
	Solar Bolt is a free website which allows users to record their electricity PV output from
	their solar photovoltaic systems. The output is represented in different views like daily, monthly etc. 
	This will allow you to see graphically your output and see how much electricity you are generating.

	If you do not own a solar PV system but would like to get an estimate of how much money you
	could save please try our solar calculator <a href="SolarBolt_Calculator.php"> Solar Energy Calculator.</a>
